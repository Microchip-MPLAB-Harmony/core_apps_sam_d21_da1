# I2C EEPROM AT24 driver - EEPROM Read Write

This example application shows how to use the AT24 driver to perform read and write operations on AT24 series of EEPROM.

## Description

- This example uses the AT24 driver to communicate with I2C based On-Board AT24MAC402 series EEPROMs to perform write and read operations in Bare-Metal environment.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/core_apps_sam_d21_da1) and then click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.
This content can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/driver/i2c_eeprom/at24/at24_eeprom_read_write/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

### Setting up [SAM D21 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamd21-xpro)

- To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:
  - One [EEPROM 3 Click](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-3-click) board
  - One [mikroBUS Xplained Pro](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO) board
- Connect [mikroBUS Xplained Pro](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO) boards on to the "EXT2" header
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application using its IDE
2. LED indicates success or failure:
    - The LED is turned ON when the value read from the EEPROM matched with the written value

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [SAM D21 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamd21-xpro) | LED0 |
