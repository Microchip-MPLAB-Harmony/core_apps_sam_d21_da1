Reads temperature every 1 second, prints on console and notifies the EEPROM client. The Time System Service is used to generate a callback every 1 second . APP_I2C_EEPROM_Tasks: . Writes temperature values to the EEPROM once the temperature read complete notification is received. The task also reads and prints the last five saved temperature data from the EEPROM when user enters any key on the console. ",

The image file could be any arbitrary JPEG (image) file chosen by the user and then renamed to** FILE_TOO_LONG_NAME_EXAMPLE_123.JPG.The reason for choosing a JPEG file for test purposes is that the duplicate file, **Dir1/FILE_TOO_LONG_NAME_EXAMPLE_123.JPG created by the demonstration could be easily verified for correctness. If the new file inside Dir1 opens for viewing on the computer and matches to original image, the test is deemed to have passed.

    "content": "This demonstration creates four tasks each of differen priority. Task1 has the lowest priority, followed by Task2, Task3 and Task4 which has the highest priority. Task1 and Task2 run periodically. Task3 blocks until a character is received on UART terminal. Task3 registers a read callback with the UART PLIB and blcoks on a UART receive semaphore. The semaphore is given from the registered callback which is called when a character is receved on the terminal. Task4 blocks until a user switch is pressed. Task4 registers a callback for the switch press event with the PIO peripheral and then blocks on the switch press semaphore. The semaphore is given from the registered callback which is called when the switch is pressed. All the tasks print messages on the UART terminal to indicate tasks entry/exit. Since all the tasks use the same UART peripheral library, a mutex is used to guard the shared resource (UART ring buffer). | Task1: Task1 is configured for priority 1 (lowest of all the application tasks). The task1 runs for about 100 ticks and then blocks for 10 milliseconds. Each time task1 is run, it prints a message on the UART console “Tsk1-P1 &lt;-“ where, the &lt;- symbol indicates that task1 is running. Just before blocking it prints another message on the UART console “Tsk1-P1 -&gt;” where, the -&gt; symbol indicates that task1 is about to put itself into a blocked state. | Task2: Task2 is configured for priority 2. The task2 runs for about 10 ticks and then blocks for 250 milliseconds. Each time task2 is run, it prints a message on the UART console “Tsk2-P2 &lt;-“ where, the &lt;- symbol indicates that task2 is running. Just before blocking it prints another message on the UART console “Tsk2-P2 -&gt;” where, the -&gt; symbol indicates that task2 is about to put itself into a blocked state. | Task3: Task3 is configured for priority 3. It remains blocked on a semaphore which is released when a character is entered on the UART console. Once active, the task reads out the received characters and toggles LED if letter ‘L’ or ‘l’ is pressed. The task then runs for about 50 ticks, before again blocking itself until a new character is received. Each time task3 is run, it prints a message on the UART console “Tsk3-P3 &lt;-“ where, the &lt;- symbol indicates that task2 is running. Just before blocking it prints another message on the UART console “Tsk3-P3 -&gt;” where, the -&gt; symbol indicates that task3 is about to put itself into a blocked state. | Task4: Task4 is configured for priority 4 (highest of all the application tasks). It remains blocked on a semaphore which is released when a user switch is pressed. Once active, the task runs for about 10 ticks, before again blocking itself until the switch is pressed again. Each time task4 is run, it prints a message on the UART console “Tsk4-P4 &lt;-“ where, the &lt;- symbol indicates that task4 is running. Just before blocking it prints another message on the UART console “Tsk4-P4 -&gt;” where, the -&gt; symbol indicates that task4 is about to put itself into a blocked state. | .
